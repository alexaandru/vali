**Vali**, a purposefully tiny validator. üîãüîãüîã are not included,
but there are recipes on how to make them ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Rather than a large collection of checks (which ultimately
imply many deps) **Vali** aims for the most things you could do
with the least amount of checks.

Non-goals:

- `slice`/`map` dive;
- cross field checks;
- anything that needs a 3rd party dep.

## Description

It has a minimal [set of checks](#available-checks) and
an easy way to add your own checks, see the [example](example_test.go) and
[vali_test.go](vali_test.go) files.

You can also change the struct tag name being used (by creating
a new `Validator`) and a few other bits, see `Validator` type
definition.

It is pointer-insensitive, will always validate the value
behind the pointer, that is, given:

```Go
Foo *string `validate:"required"`
```

passes if `*Foo != ""` NOT if `Foo != nil`.

Finally, it only validates public/exported fields. Adding validation
tags to private fields will be ignored.

### Available checks:

Multiple checks must be combined with a comma (,) extra space
is forgiven, and empty checks are ignored i.e.:
`validate:"required,,,,  uuid   , one_of:foo|bar|baz"` is fine, albeit unclean.

Both separators (between checks and between a check and its arguments)
are configurable, whereas the separator between arguments themselves (the
pipe symbol in the `a|b|c` example above) are up the each individual check,
the library doesn't care it will just pass all the arguments as a string
to the `Checker` func.

## Sample Usage

```Go
s := struct {
	Foo struct {
		Bar string `validate:"required, one_of:foo|bar|baz"`
	}
}{}

if err := vali.Validate(s); err != nil {
    fmt.Println("oh noes!...")
}
```
